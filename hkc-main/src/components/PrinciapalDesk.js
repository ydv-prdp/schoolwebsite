          <h3>PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE</h3>
          <p>
            Dear Parents and Students, Welcome to Holy Krishnaâ€™s College ! I
            extend a very warm welcome to all of you. At HKC, we believe that
            all students are gifted learners and our desire is to help them
            learn in the best way they can to nurture them as life-long
            learners. We will strive to offer an abundance of opportunities for
            students to experience, learn, explore their strengths and to hone
            their skills for their successful future. As the Principal of the
            school, I feel honoured and privileged to be a part of an
            Educational Institution where every individual is a learner and
            every day is an opportunity to learn and discover. We would like to
            create a community of learners, where everyone learns, including us
            indeed. Creating a habitat of Learning for the 21st century learner
            is the most engaging, enriching and empowering engagement a
            community undertakes. I wish to invite Parents, as collaborators in
            this endeavour. I look forward to working with you and developing a
            relationship that will assist in the growth of your child.
